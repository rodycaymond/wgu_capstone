## Application Overview

This application does the following things:

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is created through a React Application, and utilizes Typescript to maintain strong typing throughout the application.

### Backend

The server is written in Golang because of its strong typing, C-style programming mannerisms, and general syntactic preferences. Golang is becoming more of an industry standard/best practice for its design intentions and security implementations.

### Database

The database is Postgres. This is a personal preference, but there are some advantages to using postgres such as gracefully handling concurrent user interactions and certain language-specific features.
